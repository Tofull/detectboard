# DetectBoard

This is a simple tool to visualize your training process I did in less time I need to write this doc...

It parses the logs from [detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron).

No installation is required, because it is just a client-side webapp.

This tool is hosted online on my blog : https://tofull.github.io/tools/detectboard.
If you want to give it a try, I provided a log file as example in example folder.

Contributions are welcome (documentation, code, bug, issue...).

Please, give this project a star.
